# How Invasive Is Too Invasive?

In the previous post, we talked about the invasive nature of anti-cheat systems for games in order to prevent users from loading cheats. Similarly, proctoring software aims to stop a differnet kind of cheater: test cheaters. Software proctors such as Respondus Lockdown Browser, Examity, Honorlock typically require deep access into your operating system and system level features. They also may have access to your webcam or microphone to hopefully prevent cheaters with second monitors or using someone else to take the exam. 

In a technical sense, software protoctors such as Lockdown Browser *__are__* malware. They may not have the same maliciuos intentions as malware we commonly know, but they exhibit extremely similar behavior to rootkits or any other unauthorized software. Just as malware digs through your files and directories searching for personal information, proctoring software does the same just with a different purpose.
