# The Ethicality of "Cheating"

In this post, I'd like to discuss the multiple ways users bypass both anti-cheat and proctoring software. Note: *__this is NOT to endorse or encourage using any of these techniques to wrongfully finesse these systems.__*

Cheating is bad, m'kay?

# Anti-Cheats
## 1. Mouse Scripting
Many modern mouse drivers allow for scripting and rebinding mouse buttons to activate differnet buttons when pressed. Some even allow you to mind multiple keys to one button, which may give a player a mechanical advantage depending on the game. However, most games don't classify these actions as cheats. Mouse scripting is far to accessible and common place for them to seriously targeted by anit-cheats.

## 2. EFI Cheats

Cheaters can use drivers that load *before* the kernel boots, abusing the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) mappings. To put things simply, the EFI system manages device drivers, boot loaders, boot manages, and the kernel images of your operating system needed for your OS to boot. Hackers use tools to map malicious drivers in the EFI to mask as typical OS drivers, rendering them "invisible" to the anti-cheat. Essentially, cheat drivers can be run before your system boots to prepare themselves to be hidden when the anti-cheat runs. With this, cheaters are able to to read game memory and and run cheats that are tagged as seemingly innocent system calls.

# Protoctoring Software

## 1. Virtual Machines

## 2. Dual Booting

## 3. Seperate Computer
Having a "burner device" is often seen as a workaround for bad actors seeking to evade the gaze of proctoring software or anti-cheat systems. This term refers to a disposable or secondary device specifically used for the purpose of taking exams or playing games without the scrutiny of these monitoring tools. While some may view this as a practical solution to maintain privacy and autonomy, others argue that it undermines the integrity of assessments, something I agree with. The arguement of "privacy" doesn't go far considering these second devices don't typically store personal information, so running a proctor software wouldn't be a concern if you had access to one. But, if the privacy of your main device is worry, these is still an ethical way to use a secondary device.

If you thing about it, there's no real reason to cheat protoctoring software. Yes these programs have deep access into your system and application processes, but thats only if you care about the information stored on that computer. The best way to ensure your privacy and digital safety through the growing amounts of data leaks and breaches is to simply have a seperate comptuer not containing your private information. However, you should __still__ run the proctoring software on these devices. Taking an assessment without doing so is a clear ethical violation of a test's integral process as you are then simply using another device for the purpose of cheating. Getting access to a secondary computer is much easier nowadays as many schools allow for students to borrow school laptops to take tests. Using a school laptop, which only has as much of your personal information that your give it, is probably the best way to ethically take a test while not exposing all of your data to potential future harm.
